✅ AWS CLI installed in Gitpod and added AWS Access Keys and secret Access key.

Here, I followed the following Guideline and able to setup Gitpord CLI. Generated acess key and security id from AWS account and just followed and used commands. After completing this just working fine even after closing gitpord and starting again. I faced issue during this but after troubleshooting find was using space before the command.
